            "Text": "In recent times, Lung cancer is the most common cause of mortality in both men and women 
around the world. Lung cancer is the second most well-known disease after heart disease. 
Although lung cancer prevention is impossible, early detection of lung cancer can effectively 
treat lung cancer at an early stage. The possibility of a patient's survival rate increasing if lung 
cancer is identified early. To detect and diagnose lung cancer in its early stages, a variety of 
data analysis and machine learning techniques have been applied. In this paper, we applied 
supervised machine learning algorithms like SVM (Support vector machine), ANN (Artificial 
neural networks), MLR (Multiple linear regression), and RF (random forest), to detect the early 
stages of lung tumors. The main purpose of this study is to examine the success of machine 
learning algorithms in detecting lung cancer at an early stage. When compared to all other 
supervised machine learning algorithms, the Random forest model produces a high result, with 
a 99.99% accuracy rate. ",

        "Introduction": {
            "Text": "Cancer is a wide term and the most complex 
disease in people’s life. Cancer can cause by 
the development of uncontrollable cells 
which can be spread anywhere in the human 
body. General cancer symptoms are fatigue, 
weight loss, pain, cough, fever, lumps, etc. 
Cancer is also called a tumor. To save the 
lives of humans it is very important to detect 
quickly and correctly the initial stage of 
cancer. There are many kinds of cancer like 
breast, brain, lung, liver, skin cancer, etc [1]. 
Lung cancer is a form of cancer which starts 
that the abnormal cells cluster together. Lung 
cancer is the main reason for death among 
both men and women all over the world. 
Worldwide after heart disease, Lung cancer 
is 
the 
second most frequent disease. 
Uncontrollable cell growth may be the reason 
for the death of the cancer patient [2]. 
Early examination of lung tumors is critical 
in decreasing the risk of death from lung 
tumor disease. Lung cancer can spread very 
quickly to the brain, liver, bones, and adrenal 
glands, therefore,  the initial diagnosis of lung 
cancer is very necessary. Every year, almost  
1.3 million people pass away due to lung 
cancer 
around the world. In 2018, 
approximately 234,030 Americans will be 
diagnosed of which 121,480 males and 
112,350 females. Due to lung cancer, 
approximately 121,680 deaths will occur of 
which 83,550 males and 70,500 females 
[2][3]. Common ways to diagnose lung 
cancer include Magnetic Resonance Imaging 
(MRI),  CT (Computed Tomography) scan, 
and 
Positron 
Emission 
Tomography 
(PET)[4]. Lung carcinoma is another name 
for lung cancer. Lung cancer has two 
categories: SCLC( Small Cell Lung Cancer) 
and NSCLC( Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
)[5]. SCLC: It’s a generally rare form of lung 
cancer. Around 15% of lung cancer cases 
have a history of small cell lung cancer. 
Small lung cancer spread very quickly. 
NSCLC: It’s a quite frequent kind of lung 
cancer. Around 85% of lung cancer cases 
have a history of non-small cell lung cancer. 
This type of lung cancer is more dangerous 
than SCLC because it spread slowly. NSCLC 
is further divided into three categories:  
NSCLC has four stages which include Stage 
|, Stage ||, Stage |||, and Stage |V [6]. 
In Stage |, cancer produces 60 t0 80% in a 
single lung and doesn’t develop in lymph 
nodes or distant organs. 
In Stage ||, 30 to 50% of cancer grows in 
lymph nodes, rather than distant organs. 
In stage |||, the tumor expands 10 t0 15%  in 
nodes and builds in the center of the chest. 
In stage  |V, the Tumor spread throughout the 
body. 
Many studies have been undertaken on the 
causes of lung cancer, with the conclusion 
that smoking is the primary cause. Smoking 
harms the lungs. In the United States, 
cigarette smoking is a factor of 80 t0 90% of 
deaths due to lung cancer. Other tobacco 
products such as cigars, pipes, or snuff (a 
powdered form of tobacco) raise the risk of 
lung cancer and other kinds of cancer such as 
mouth cancer. The use of tobacco smoking 
for a  long time begins with lung cancer. 
According to the survey, smoking caused 
lung cancer in 90% of males and 75 t0 80% 
of females. It is a reality that 10 to 15% of 
people who never smoke in their life contain 
lung cancer.  The reason for lung cancer may 
be passive smoking, air pollution, asbestos, 
and radon gas [7].  
Machine Learning is an artificial intelligence 
field that applies computer algorithms to 
conclude various outcomes from data sets. 
Machine learning provides guidance to 
execute complex tasks more creatively and 
efficiently. 
Many machine learning 
algorithms are applied to the data set to 
measure the accuracy of the diagnosis of lung 
cancer. In the past survey, many machine 
learning techniques have been tried to detect 
and predict lung tumors [3][8][9] Support 
Vector Machine (SVM), Artificial Neural 
Network (ANN), Naive Bayes (NB), 
Convolutional Neural network (CNN), 
Recurrent Neural network, Decision Tree, k
nearest neighbours. 
The innovation of this study is too early 
diagnoses lung cancer from the data set. This 
research work on four well-known machine 
learning classifiers which are SVM,  ANN,  
MLR, and RF to detect lung cancer. In the 
end, we compared the accuracy and find out 
the best classifier to detect lung cancer. 
Figure 1 shows the workflow of our study. 
Finally, we determined the goals of our 
proposed research and compared model 
findings to determine which model works 
best. Further work divides into sections. The 
second section contains the literature review, 
the third section described the methodology 
of the proposed algorithms, In the fourth 
section, 
analyzed the results of the 
experiment, and the conclusion and future 
work are in the last section.    ",

            "Text": "Machine learning is a method of diagnosis of 
lung cancer which is the leading cause of 
death worldwide. Many machine learning 
applications are already used in the field of 
Lung cancer detection. In previous work, 
many researchers have used image 
processing methods, machine learning 
approaches, or hybrid techniques to diagnose 
lung cancer.  
In this paper [8] Author used the clinical 
images dataset for the image processing 
methodology. 
The image processing 
approach is divided into five different steps:  
1)  collect images   
2) image processing and segmentation  
3) extraction of features  
4) classification of images  
5) performance evaluation.  
Seven classifiers as KNN( k-nearest 
neighbours), SVM(support vector machine), 
DT(Decision tree), MNB(Multinomial naïve 
Bayes), SGD(Stochastic gradient descent), 
RF(Random forest),  and MLP( Multi-layer 
perceptron) was used to evaluate the 
performance based on the following 
parameters: accuracy, F1 score, precision, 
recall and then calculated using a confusion 
matrix. In the end, MLP obtains higher 
accuracy with the value of 88.55%  as 
compared to other classifiers. 
The major goal of this paper[10] is to use 
image transformation and machine learning 
methods to identify lung cancer and its 
phases. Many steps are involved in the image 
processing approach,  First, 200 CT scan 
reports and blood samples with CT scan 
images were used as an input for image 
processing. Secondly, make a Grayscale 
image out of an RGB image. To convert the 
RGB image to a Grayscale image first we 
find out the average of the colour image and 
then replace the RGB pixel with the average. 
Formula of average [average = R+G+B/3]. In 
the third step, a median filter was used to 
extract the noise from a grayscale picture. In 
the fourth step, the grayscale picture is 
converted to a binary image. The grayscale 
image has(From 0 to 255 )pixel range and the 
binary image has (0,1). When converting a 
grayscale picture to a binary image, the 
threshold value 175 is occupied. In the fifth 
segmentation step, decrease the irrelevant 
information from the image and convert the 
duplicate CT scan image into an informative 
which is easily examined in detail. In the 
feature extraction step, the segmented output 
is used as an input for the feature extraction. 
Feature extraction is a technique for 
extracting a pattern from a duplicate image 
using algorithms. These features, such as 
Area, Perimeter, and Eccentricity, are 
provided by feature extraction. In the last 
step, the Support vector machine (SVM) 
arranges data and manages the pattern. SVM 
was used for classification and regression 
problems and categorized positive and 
negative samples of lung cancer images. In 
this paper, the SVM classifier is used as 
compared to other classifiers like Decision 
trees, Naïve Bayes, and Random forest 
because SVM is less time-consuming. 
In this study [3], To identify the lung tumor 
access the dataset from Standard Digital 
Image Database. The dataset consists of 247 
CT images, 154 images labelled with a 
nodule, and 93 images labelled without a 
nodule. The dataset was divided into two 
parts: training and testing. Randomly, for the 
training set, 70% of the dataset was 
employed, while for the testing set 30% of the 
dataset 
was 
employed. PCA(Principal 
component analysis), KNN( k-nearest 
neighbours), SVM(Support vector machine), 
NB(Naïve Bayes), DT(Decision tree), and 
ANN( Artificial Neural Network) are among 
the machine learning techniques used to 
detect lung cancer. Then compare all the 
classifier’s 
accuracy before and after 
preprocessing.  In the end, ANN  has higher 
accuracy of 82,43%  than other classifiers 
after image processing, and the Decision tree 
has higher accuracy of 93,24%  than other 
algorithms without image processing. 
In this paper [11], To save the lives of 
humans by analyzing the initial stage of lung 
cancer many machine learning algorithms are 
used. Lung cancer datasets are sourced from 
the UCI Machine Learning Repository and 
Data. World. The K-fold cross-validation 
method splits datasets into two parts: training 
and testing. Many classification methods are 
used to attain accuracy including Logistic 
Regression, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and 
Support Vector Machine is used and then 
compared the accuracy of each classifier with 
another classifier. SVM has a higher 
accuracy of 99.2%  than all other classifiers. 
In this study [7], Author mostly focused on 
the segmentation and classification method. 
An Unsharp mask filter is used to sharpen the 
image. In image processing,  an unsharp 
mask is used to convert the blurred image into 
original 
images. 
For calculating the 
background and foreground color intensity 
level of the image many thresholding 
methods are used but here we use the 
OTSU’S thresholding. The mean of OTSU’S 
thresholding to estimate the following 
parameters ( weight, mean, variance) of 
background and foreground of all levels. To 
detect the cancer region and actual affected 
area we used an Adaptive Canny algorithm 
and this method was estimated over Otsu's 
global 
thresholding method. For the 
segmentation 
process, 
the 
k-nearest 
neighbour classification method is used.  The 
KNN method has some effective applications 
like machine learning, pattern recognition, 
data mining, object recognition, etc. To 
calculate the classification results from 
Bayesian Regularization neural network is 
used. BRNN attains high accuracy with a 
value of 99.5%. 
The Author [5] has proposed a CAD 
(Computer-aided diagnosis) system using the 
SVM to categorise abnormal or normal 
images using the CT images dataset. The 
CAD system has four phases to detect lung 
cancer from CT images. These stages are 
preprocessing of images, extraction of 
features, 
selection 
of 
features, 
and 
categorization. In this study, a Gray level co
occurrence matrix was applied to extract 
image information such as colour, shape, 
texture, etc, and ANT Colony Optimization 
was employed as a feature selection method 
for better outcomes. To categorize the normal 
and abnormal photos, two machine learning 
classifiers, ANN and SVM, were applied. 
ANN achieve high accuracy of 98.40%  as 
compared to SVM's accuracy of 93.2%. 
Furthermore,[12] Deep Learning Approach is 
employed to diagnose lung cancer at the 
initial stages which are very important to 
decrease the possibility of death. In this 
study, the TensorFlow library is used to 
diagnose lung cancer. SPIE-AAPM dataset 
used consists of 70 CT images. The training 
set is made up of 40 photographs, while the 
test set is made up of 30 images. 3D 
Convolutional Neural Network is utilized to 
classify the lung nodules which can be benign 
or cancerous. To calculate the performance of 
the model 30 CT images are used as a 
resulting in which 17 patients are malignant 
and 13 patients are benign. Several metrics 
are used to assess the performance of the 
classification method but in this work, a 
confusion matrix is employed to evaluate the 
achievement of binary classification. The 
Confusion Matrix shows  70% accuracy of 
3D CNN. 
This work [13] has proposed the deep 
residual network to detect lung cancer using 
the CT scan images dataset that is in DICOM 
(digital imaging and communication in 
medicine) image format. First, perform the 
preprocessing method on the dataset. In 
preprocessing, to determine and split lung 
nodules perform many regions growing and 
morphological operations and then used the 
UNet and ResNet models for feature 
extraction. In segmentation, analyze the 
distinctive features from the CT scan images. 
In this work two tree-based classifiers as 
XGBoost and RandomForest used. In the 
end, compared the accuracy of the proposed 
models. UNet+RandoomForest individually 
get 
74% accuracy, ResNet+XSBoost 
achieved 76% accuracy, and the combination 
of 
UNet+RandoomForest 
ResNet+XSBoost obtain 84% accuracy. 
and 
The Multi-class SVM classifier is used in the 
work [14] to detect and predict lung cancer. 
In this work, MATLAB was used for built an 
algorithm to detect and predict lung cancer. 
In 
each phase of classification, image 
enhancement and segmentation were done 
separately. 
Image enhancement is an 
approach for improving the quality and 
information of a data image. Many 
approaches such as image scaling, spatial 
transformation, and contrast enhancement 
have been promoted to improve images. 
Watershed 
transformed 
is 
used 
for 
segmentation to achieve a better resolution in 
CT images and Gray Level Co-Occurance 
method is used for feature extraction. For 
classifying cancer nodules SVM classifier is 
used that is used for both classification and 
relapse purposes. Our proposed method 
achieves higher accuracy. 
This research work [15] addressed various 
segmentation approaches such as Hopfield 
Neural Network (HNN) and Fuzzy C-Mean 
(FCM) clustering algorithms methods. To 
diagnose the early stage of lung cancer used  
Sputum color images. In this study, a 
thresholding classifier was used to handle the 
problem of extreme fluctuation in the grey 
level and the related contrast between the 
pictures with 98% accuracy. The results of 
HNN Segmentation exceed the results of 
FCM because FCM failed in extracting the 
nucleus and cytoplasm areas. 
[16]Developed a computer-assisted detection 
approach to distinguish between malignant 
and non-cancerous tissue in DICOM 
images.CNN was used for feature extraction. 
Many machine learning classifiers were used 
to classify the cancerous and normal images 
and compared their accuracy with each other 
to determine which one is best for diagnosing 
lung and pancreatic tumors.  
An Artificial Neural Network [17] was 
developed to identify the presence and 
absence of lung cancer. ANN uses the 
symptoms dataset to perform two layers of 
training and validation.ANN attains the 
highest 96.67% accuracy which shows that 
ANN can detect lung cancer. 
A group of Authors [18] proposed a new 
system to improve the current model’s 
accuracy. The current model has  88.4% 
accuracy To increase the accuracy of the 
existing model, a median filter is employed 
in the proposed system's preprocessing stage 
to remove salt and paper noise from CT 
pictures, which causes challenges in accurate 
lung cancer identification. After this gaussian 
filter applies to smooth the images and 
remove the speckle noise from CT images. In 
the segmentation step, a watershed technique 
was utilized to divide the image into areas to 
examine the meaningful information. In the 
feature extraction step, extracting features 
such as area, perimeter, centroid, diameter, 
eccentricity, and Mean intensity were 
employed as training features to build the 
classifier. The SVM classifier was utilized to 
identify the nodule as malignant or beginning 
in CT scan images. The proposed model has 
higher accuracy of 92% than the current 
model. 
In this paper [19] image processing technique 
was used to classify the cancerous and non
cancerous nodules using MRI, CT, and 
Ultrasound images but in the experiment 
section 6 CT Scan images and 15 MRI 
images of the lung are used. The image 
processing method is used to decrease the 
noise and distortion in the image which is 
very beneficial for the segmentation step. For 
both CT and MRI pictures, the Gabor filter 
was applied to improve the pictures. In the 
image enhancement step, smoothing of the 
image, blurring, and elimination of noise is 
involved. For the next step, picture filtering 
is highly effective. After image processing, a 
canny filter is used for edge detection. To 
decrease the unnecessary detail of images 
data morphological processing techniques 
like Erosion and dilation are used. For image 
segmentation, Superpixel Segmentation was 
used. Feature extraction is a very important 
stage and used many algorithms to produce 
the final output in which we conclude the 
normality and abnormality of the image. For 
feature selection and feature classification 
through GUI (Graphical user interface) in 
MATLAB are used different algorithms such 
as Particle swarm optimization (PSO), 
Genetic Optimization, and SVM(support 
vector machine) give result as normal or 
abnormal nodule and attains 89.5% accuracy. 
[20] Proposed five steps of image processing 
technique for the analysis of lung images. In 
1st step, collected data contain the CT scan 
images of patients who have cancer and non
cancer. In the 2nd step, the image 
preprocessing technique is applied which is 
very important and beneficial for the 
segmentation 
of 
images. 
In 
image 
preprocessing, 2 steps involve the first one is 
to use the median filter to remove the noise 
from the images dataset and the second one is 
to use the contrast adjustment technique to 
enhance the refined images. In the 3rd step, 
an input image is segmented into several 
parts and morphological operations are 
utilized to select the appropriate area of 
interest (ROI) based on the structuring 
element. After this, masked it to extract the 
tumor region from the CT scan image. In the 
4th step, after the segmentation step, to gain 
the tumor region calculate the features of the 
tumor-like area, perimeter, and eccentricity 
and then send them to the classifier. In the 5th 
step, an SVM classifier is employed to 
classify the picture dataset as cancerous or 
benign.",

images were used as an input for image
processing. Secondly, make a Grayscale
image out of an RGB image. To convert the
RGB image to a Grayscale image first we
find out the average of the colour image and
then replace the RGB pixel with the average.
Formula of average [average = R+G+B/3]. In
the third step, a median filter was used to
extract the noise from a grayscale picture. In
the fourth step, the grayscale picture is
converted to a binary image. The grayscale
image has(From 0 to 255 )pixel range and the
binary image has (0,1). When converting a
grayscale picture to a binary image, the
threshold value 175 is occupied. In the fifth
segmentation step, decrease the irrelevant
information from the image and convert the
duplicate CT scan image into an informative
which is easily examined in detail. In the
feature extraction step, the segmented output
is used as an input for the feature extraction.
Feature extraction is a technique for
extracting a pattern from a duplicate image
using algorithms. These features, such as
Area, Perimeter, and Eccentricity, are
provided by feature extraction. In the last
step, the Support vector machine (SVM)
arranges data and manages the pattern. SVM
was used for classification and regression
problems and categorized positive and
negative samples of lung cancer images. In
this paper, the SVM classifier is used as
compared to other classifiers like Decision
trees, Naïve Bayes, and Random forest
because SVM is less time-consuming.
In this study [3], To identify the lung tumor
access the dataset from Standard DigitalImage Database. The dataset consists of 247
CT images, 154 images labelled with a
nodule, and 93 images labelled without a
nodule. The dataset was divided into two
parts: training and testing. Randomly, for the
training set, 70% of the dataset was
employed, while for the testing set 30% of the
dataset was employed. PCA(Principal
component analysis), KNN( k-nearest
neighbours), SVM(Support vector machine),
NB(Naïve Bayes), DT(Decision tree), and
ANN( Artificial Neural Network) are among
the machine learning techniques used to
detect lung cancer. Then compare all the
classifier’s accuracy before and after
preprocessing. In the end, ANN has higher
accuracy of 82,43% than other classifiers
after image processing, and the Decision tree
has higher accuracy of 93,24% than other
algorithms without image processing.
In this paper [11], To save the lives of
humans by analyzing the initial stage of lung
cancer many machine learning algorithms are
used. Lung cancer datasets are sourced from
the UCI Machine Learning Repository and
Data. World. The K-fold cross-validation
method splits datasets into two parts: training
and testing. Many classification methods are
used to attain accuracy including Logistic
Regression, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, and
Support Vector Machine is used and then
compared the accuracy of each classifier with
another classifier. SVM has a higher
accuracy of 99.2% than all other classifiers.
In this study [7], Author mostly focused on
the segmentation and classification method.
An Unsharp mask filter is used to sharpen the
image. In image processing, an unsharp
mask is used to convert the blurred image into
original images. For calculating the
background and foreground color intensity
level of the image many thresholding
methods are used but here we use the
OTSU’S thresholding. The mean of OTSU’S
thresholding to estimate the following
parameters ( weight, mean, variance) of
background and foreground of all levels. To
detect the cancer region and actual affected
area we used an Adaptive Canny algorithm
and this method was estimated over Otsu's
global thresholding method. For the
segmentation process, the k-nearest
neighbour classification method is used. The
KNN method has some effective applications
like machine learning, pattern recognition,
data mining, object recognition, etc. To
calculate the classification results from
Bayesian Regularization neural network is
used. BRNN attains high accuracy with a
value of 99.5%.
The Author [5] has proposed a CAD
(Computer-aided diagnosis) system using theSVM to categorise abnormal or normal
images using the CT images dataset. The
CAD system has four phases to detect lung
cancer from CT images. These stages are
preprocessing of images, extraction of
features, selection of features, and
categorization. In this study, a Gray level co-
occurrence matrix was applied to extract
image information such as colour, shape,
texture, etc, and ANT Colony Optimization
was employed as a feature selection method
for better outcomes. To categorize the normal
and abnormal photos, two machine learning
classifiers, ANN and SVM, were applied.
ANN achieve high accuracy of 98.40% as
compared to SVM's accuracy of 93.2%.
Furthermore,[12] Deep Learning Approach is
employed to diagnose lung cancer at the
initial stages which are very important to
decrease the possibility of death. In this
study, the TensorFlow library is used to
diagnose lung cancer. SPIE-AAPM dataset
used consists of 70 CT images. The training
set is made up of 40 photographs, while the
test set is made up of 30 images. 3D
Convolutional Neural Network is utilized to
classify the lung nodules which can be benign
or cancerous. To calculate the performance of
the model 30 CT images are used as a
resulting in which 17 patients are malignant
and 13 patients are benign. Several metrics
are used to assess the performance of the
classification method but in this work, a
confusion matrix is employed to evaluate the
achievement of binary classification. The
Confusion Matrix shows 70% accuracy of
3D CNN.
This work [13] has proposed the deep
residual network to detect lung cancer using
the CT scan images dataset that is in DICOM
(digital imaging and communication in
medicine) image format. First, perform the
preprocessing method on the dataset. In
preprocessing, to determine and split lung
nodules perform many regions growing and
morphological operations and then used the
UNet and ResNet models for feature
extraction. In segmentation, analyze the
distinctive features from the CT scan images.
In this work two tree-based classifiers as
XGBoost and RandomForest used. In the
end, compared the accuracy of the proposed
models. UNet+RandoomForest individually
get 74% accuracy, ResNet+XSBoost
achieved 76% accuracy, and the combination
of UNet+RandoomForest and
ResNet+XSBoost obtain 84% accuracy.
The Multi-class SVM classifier is used in the
work [14] to detect and predict lung cancer.
In this work, MATLAB was used for built an
algorithm to detect and predict lung cancer.
In each phase of classification, imageenhancement and segmentation were done
separately. Image enhancement is an
approach for improving the quality and
information of a data image. Many
approaches such as image scaling, spatial
transformation, and contrast enhancement
have been promoted to improve images.
Watershed transformed is used for
segmentation to achieve a better resolution in
CT images and Gray Level Co-Occurance
method is used for feature extraction. For
classifying cancer nodules SVM classifier is
used that is used for both classification and
relapse purposes. Our proposed method
achieves higher accuracy.
This research work [15] addressed various
segmentation approaches such as Hopfield
Neural Network (HNN) and Fuzzy C-Mean
(FCM) clustering algorithms methods. To
diagnose the early stage of lung cancer used
Sputum color images. In this study, a
thresholding classifier was used to handle the
problem of extreme fluctuation in the grey
level and the related contrast between the
pictures with 98% accuracy. The results of
HNN Segmentation exceed the results of
FCM because FCM failed in extracting the
nucleus and cytoplasm areas.
[16]Developed a computer-assisted detection
approach to distinguish between malignant
and non-cancerous tissue in DICOM
images.CNN was used for feature extraction.
Many machine learning classifiers were used
to classify the cancerous and normal images
and compared their accuracy with each other
to determine which one is best for diagnosing
lung and pancreatic tumors.
An Artificial Neural Network [17] was
developed to identify the presence and
absence of lung cancer. ANN uses the
symptoms dataset to perform two layers of
training and validation.ANN attains the
highest 96.67% accuracy which shows that
ANN can detect lung cancer.
A group of Authors [18] proposed a new
system to improve the current model’s
accuracy. The current model has 88.4%
accuracy To increase the accuracy of the
existing model, a median filter is employed
in the proposed system's preprocessing stage
to remove salt and paper noise from CT
pictures, which causes challenges in accurate
lung cancer identification. After this gaussian
filter applies to smooth the images and
remove the speckle noise from CT images. In
the segmentation step, a watershed technique
was utilized to divide the image into areas to
examine the meaningful information. In the
feature extraction step, extracting features
such as area, perimeter, centroid, diameter,
eccentricity, and Mean intensity were
employed as training features to build theclassifier. The SVM classifier was utilized to
identify the nodule as malignant or beginning
in CT scan images. The proposed model has
higher accuracy of 92% than the current
model.
In this paper [19] image processing technique
was used to classify the cancerous and non-
cancerous nodules using MRI, CT, and
Ultrasound images but in the experiment
section 6 CT Scan images and 15 MRI
images of the lung are used. The image
processing method is used to decrease the
noise and distortion in the image which is
very beneficial for the segmentation step. For
both CT and MRI pictures, the Gabor filter
was applied to improve the pictures. In the
image enhancement step, smoothing of the
image, blurring, and elimination of noise is
involved. For the next step, picture filtering
is highly effective. After image processing, a
canny filter is used for edge detection. To
decrease the unnecessary detail of images
data morphological processing techniques
like Erosion and dilation are used. For image
segmentation, Superpixel Segmentation was
used. Feature extraction is a very important
stage and used many algorithms to produce
the final output in which we conclude the
normality and abnormality of the image. For
feature selection and feature classification
through GUI (Graphical user interface) in
MATLAB are used different algorithms such
as Particle swarm optimization (PSO),
Genetic Optimization, and SVM(support
vector machine) give result as normal or
abnormal nodule and attains 89.5% accuracy.
[20] Proposed five steps of image processing
technique for the analysis of lung images. In
1st step, collected data contain the CT scan
images of patients who have cancer and non-
cancer. In the 2nd step, the image
preprocessing technique is applied which is
very important and beneficial for the
segmentation of images. In image
preprocessing, 2 steps involve the first one is
to use the median filter to remove the noise
from the images dataset and the second one is
to use the contrast adjustment technique to
enhance the refined images. In the 3rd step,
an input image is segmented into several
parts and morphological operations are
utilized to select the appropriate area of
interest (ROI) based on the structuring
element. After this, masked it to extract the
tumor region from the CT scan image. In the
4th step, after the segmentation step, to gain
the tumor region calculate the features of the
tumor-like area, perimeter, and eccentricity
and then send them to the classifier. In the 5th
step, an SVM classifier is employed to
classify the picture dataset as cancerous or
benign",

### General Overview

These three images contain a total of four line charts, each illustrating the prediction results of a different machine learning model. The models are (a) ANN, (b) Multiple Linear Regression, (c) Random Forest, and (d) Support Vector Machine.

A key observation across all four charts is their striking visual similarity. They all plot predicted values for the same set of data points, and the prediction patterns are nearly identical. This suggests that all four models performed very similarly on this particular test dataset.

**Common Chart Elements:**
* **X-Axis:** Represents individual data points or samples, numbered sequentially from 1 to approximately 197.
* **Y-Axis:** Represents the predicted value or class label, ranging from -0.5 to 2.5.
* **Prediction Values:** In all charts, the predictions are not continuous but rather discrete, jumping between three distinct levels: **0**, **1**, and **2**. This indicates a classification task, likely corresponding to the categories seen in your earlier flowchart (e.g., 0 = No Cancer, 1 = Benign, 2 = Malignant).

### **Image 1: `image_bbe9bc.png`**

* **Chart Title:** (a) Prediction result of ANN model
* **Description:** This line chart shows the predictions made by the Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. The line fluctuates rapidly and erratically between the values of 0, 1, and 2 across the dataset. There are no smooth transitions; the model assigns one of the three class labels to each data point. For example, the predictions for the first few data points are approximately 0, 2, 2, 2, 2, 0, 1, 2, etc.

### **Image 2: `image_bbe9c3.png`**

This image contains two separate charts.

* **Top Chart Title:** (b) Prediction result of Multiple linear regression
* **Description:** This chart displays the predictions from the Multiple Linear Regression model. The visual pattern of the line is almost indistinguishable from the ANN model's chart. It shows the same rapid switching between the discrete class labels of 0, 1, and 2, indicating that its predictive behavior on this data was virtually the same as the ANN.

* **Bottom Chart Title:** (c) Prediction result of Random forest model
* **Description:** This chart shows the predictions from the Random Forest model. Once again, the pattern is extremely similar to the previous two models. The line graph illustrates the model's classification for each data point, with the output consistently being one of the three target values (0, 1, or 2).

### **Image 3: `image_bbec6b.png`**

* **Chart Title:** (d) Prediction result of Support vector machine model
* **Description:** This chart visualizes the predictions of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model. As with all the others, it depicts a highly volatile line jumping between the discrete values of 0, 1, and 2. Its predictive output across the ~197 data points is visually identical to the ANN, Multiple Linear Regression, and Random Forest models.",
